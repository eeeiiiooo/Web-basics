        <h1 id="d" >An introduction to limited migrant rights</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p id="s">This is a huge issue as immigrants have a very limited amount of rights because of the misunderstanding many people have regarding to where they come from.</p>
         <link rel="stylesheet" href="homepage.css">
         <ul id="c">
            <li>Without strong legal protections, migrants are vulnerable to labor exploitation, wage theft, unsafe working conditions, and even human trafficking.
</li>
<li>Migrants also arent able to do as much as people who have green cards or other things inheritied at birth if you are born in the US.</li>
<li>Legal protections are essential for migrants as it greatly impacts their process to be living in the US.</li>
<li>There is a constant fear of deportation</li>
<li>Migrants are always being treated unfairly mostly labor exploitation</li>
         </ul>
         <p id="r">Limited migrant rights pose significant dangers both to individuals and to broader society. When migrants are denied legal protections, access to healthcare, fair wages, and safe working conditions, they become vulnerable to exploitation, abuse, and human trafficking. This marginalization often forces them into informal or illegal labor markets, where their lack of legal status can be used against them. Without the ability to report crimes or seek justice, migrants may endure dangerous environments in silence. Furthermore, limiting rights fosters social exclusion and resentment, undermining social cohesion and economic stability. Ultimately, denying migrants their rights erodes human dignity and weakens the foundational principles of justice and equality in any society.
